This file is where you will tell us details about the process you went through in creating your project. This is where we want a record of your thoughts, rough notes, failed attempts, things that you tried to get to work that didn't work, etc. e.g. "My first step was to figure out what my main classes will be. I figured out they were ... And then I tried to write code for ... This code didn't work because ..."

You have two options for the format (you can also mix and match the two) -

(1)

e.g.

I looked at [this website], which was helpful.
I managed to almost finish adding it, but [this went wrong].
I wanted to add it because [...], but decided not to in the end, because [...].
If I had more time, I would [...]

OR

(2)
Instead of dividing it up by days, you can divide it up
by task/feature. 

e.g.
Task 1: Added New Monster
I tried to add this by [...]. What worked well was [...]
What didn't work the way I wanted it to was [...]

Task 2: Adding Invisible Treasure
I tried to add this by [...]. What worked well was [...]
What didn't work the way I wanted it to was [...]
